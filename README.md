need to get the details for all the social media platforms
then use them & curator.io to embed posts into the "social" page.

Need to level the images on the home page
Need to get rid of all the stuff we aren't using

Change the images on the "What We've Been up to" page/ entirely remove that as we have the social page.
Make the "Contact Us" heading on contact.html a bit nicer

Start the youtube channel, so that we can make links for it
